# Pippi Sits on the Gate and Climbs a Tree

Outside Villa Villekulla sat Pippi, Tommy, and Annika. Pippi was sitting on one of the gateposts, and Annika was on the other, while Tommy was sitting on the gate itself. It was a warm and beautiful day in late August. A pear tree that stood very close to the gate stretched its branches so far down that the children could sit there and pick the best little yellow-and-red August pears without much trouble at all. They munched and crunched, spitting the seeds out onto the road.

 Villa Villekulla stood just where the little town ended and the countryside began, and where the street turned into a country road. The people in the little town were very fond of taking a stroll out toward Villa Villekulla, because that was the prettiest area of all.

 Just as the children were sitting there eating pears, a girl came walking down the road from town. When she caught sight of the children she stopped and asked, "Have you seen my pappa go past?"

 "Hmm," said Pippi. "What does he look like? Does he have blue eyes?"

 "Yes," said the girl.

"About average height, not too tall and not too short?"

"Yes," said the girl.

"A black hat and black shoes?"

"Yes, that's right," said the girl eagerly.

"Nope, we haven't seen him," said Pippi firmly.

The girl looked disappointed and started off without another word.

"Wait a minute," Pippi called after her. "Is he bald?"

"No, he certainly is not," said the girl angrily.

"Lucky for him," said Pippi as she spit out a seed.

The girl was now in a hurry to leave, but then Pippi shouted, "Does he have unnaturally big ears that reach all the way down to his shoulders?"

"No," said the girl, turning around in surprise. "Surely you don't mean that you've seen a man walk past here with big ears like that?"

"I've never seen anyone walk with his ears," said Pippi. "Everyone I know walks with his feet."

"Ugh, how stupid you are. I mean, have you really, seen a man who has such big ears?"

"Well, no," said Pippi. "Nobody has big ears like that. That would be absurd. And how would it look? Nobody should have ears as big as that. At least not in this country," she added after giving it some thought. "In China things are a little different, you know. I once saw a Chinese man in Shanghai. His ears were so big that he used them as a cloak. Whenever it rained he would just crawl in under his ears, and that was the warmest and best place to be. Although it wasn't so nice for his ears, of course. If the weather was especially bad, he used to invite his friends and acquaintances to camp out under his ears. There they would sit, singing their melancholy songs, until the storm had passed. They were all very fond of him because of his ears. Hai Shang was his name.You should have seen Hai Shang dashing off to work in the morning! He would always come running at the last minute because he was so fond of sleeping late in the morning, and you can't imagine how sweet it looked when he came rushing up with his ears fluttering behind him like two big yellow sails."
