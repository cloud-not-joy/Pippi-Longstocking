# pippi Organizes an Expedition 

"Today we're not going to school," Tommy told Pippi. "Because it's a house-cleaning holiday."

"Ha!" cried Pippi. "Yet another injustice! I certainly don't get any house-cleaning holiday, not me, no matter how much I might need it. Just look at my kitchen floor! But actually," she added, "when I really think about it, I can clean even without a holiday. And that's what I'm thinking of doing right now, cleaning holiday or no cleaning holiday. I'd like to see somebody try and stop me! Go and sit on the kitchen table so you won't get in the way."

Tommy and Annika obediently climbed up onto the table, and Mr. Nilsson hopped up there too and then lay down to sleep on Annika's lap.

Pippi heated a big kettle of water, which she then emptied onto the kitchen floor. After that she took off her big shoes and placed them neatly on the breadboard. Then she tied two scrub brushes onto her bare feet and began skating all over the floor, making a squishing noise as she plowed her way through the water.

"I really should have been a skating princess," she said, lifting one leg straight up in the air so that the scrub brush on her left foot hit the ceiling lamp and broke off a piece.

"I've got grace and charm, at least," she went on, taking a big leap over a chair that stood in her way.

"Well, it must be clean by now," she said at last, and took off the brushes.

"Aren't you going to dry the floor?" asked Annika.

"Nope, it can dry in the sun," said Pippi. "I don't think it'll catch cold, as long as it keeps moving."

Tommy and Annika climbed down from the table and crossed the floor as carefully as they could so they wouldn't get wet.

Outside, the sun was shining in a bright blue sky. It was one of those dazzling September days when you feel like going for a walk in the woods. Pippi had an idea.

"What do you think about taking Mr. Nilsson with us and going on a little expedition?"

"Oh, yes," shouted Tommy and Annika with delight. "Run home and ask your mother then," said Pippi."In the meantime I'll make a packed lunch."

Tommy and Annika thought that was a good plan. They dashed home, and it wasn't long before they were back. By then Pippi was already standing at the gate with Mr. Nilsson on her shoulder, a walking stick in one hand and a big basket in the other.

At first the children walked along the country road, but then they turned off into a field where a nice little path wound its way between birch trees and hazel thickets. After a while they came to a gate, and beyond the gate was a field that was even more beautiful. But a cow had taken up a position right in front of the gate, and she didn't look as if she wanted to move. Annika shouted at the cow, and Tommy bravely went over and tried to shove her aside, but she refused to budge from the spot. She just stared at the children with her big cow eyes. To put an end to the whole thing, Pippi set down the basket and went over and lifted the cow out of the way. Embarrassed, the cow lumbered off through the hazel thickets.

"To think that cows can be so bullheaded," said Pippi as she jumped over the gate, landing on both feet. "And what happens then? Bulls get cowheaded, of course! It's really quite disgusting to think about."

"What a beautiful, beautiful field," cried Annika with delight, stepping from one rock to another. Tommy had brought along the dagger that Pippi had given him, and he cut walking sticks for both Annika and himself. He also cut his thumb a bit, but that didn't matter.

"Maybe we should pick a few toadstools," said Pippi, breaking off a beautiful red toadstool.

"I wonder if it's all right to eat this kind," she went on.

"You can't very well drink it, as far as I know, so I suppose there's no other choice but to eat it. I hope it's all right!"

She bit off a big piece of the toadstool and swallowed it.

"No problem," she proclaimed with delight. "Well, that's the kind we should collect and cook next time," she said, tossing the toadstool high over the treetops.

"What do you have in the basket, Pippi?" asked Annika. "Some goodies?"

"I'm not going to tell you, not even for a thousand kronor," Pippi told her. "First we have to find a good place where we can spread out everything."

The children eagerly began looking for just such a place. Annika found a big flat rock she thought was suitable, but it was swarming with red ants.

"I don't want to sit with them, because I haven't been properly introduced," said Pippi.

"And besides, they bite," said Tommy.

"Do they?" said Pippi. "Well, bite them back!"

Then Tommy caught sight of a small glade between a couple of hazel thickets, and that's where he thought they should sit.

"No, you know what? There's not enough sunshine there to make my freckles happy," said Pippi. "And . I think freckles are so nice-looking."

Some distance away was a small hill that could be easily and quickly climbed. On top of the hill was a sunny little ledge, just like a balcony. That's where they sat down.

"Now close your eyes while I take everything out," said Pippi. Tommy and Annika shut their eyes as tight as they could. They heard Pippi opening the basket and rustling some paper.

"One. . . two. . . nineteen. . . now you can look," Pippi said at last. And so they looked. And they shouted with delight when they saw all the treats that Pippi had set out on the bare rock. There were delicious little sandwiches with meatballs and ham, a whole stack of pancakes with sugar, several pieces of little brown sausage, and three pineapple puddings. Because you see, Pippi had learned all about preparing food from the cook on her father's ship.

"It's great having a house-cleaning holiday," said Tommy with his mouth full of pancake. "We should have them all the time."

"That's going too far," said Pippi. "I don't like cleaning that much. It's fun, there's no doubt about it, but not every dayâ€”that would get tiresome."

At last the children were so full that they could hardly move, and so they sat there in the sunshine,
just enjoying themselves.

"I wonder whether it's hard to fly," said Pippi, peering over the rim of the ledge with a dreamy expression. There was a steep drop beneath them, and it was an awfully long way to the ground.

"It should be easy enough to learn to fly down," she went on. "I'm sure it's much harder to fly up. But a person could always start with the easiest part. I think I'll try it!"

"No, Pippi!" shouted both Tommy and Annika. "Oh, please, Pippi, don't do it!"

But Pippi was already standing on the edge of the precipice.

"Fly, you flighty flea, fly, and the flighty flea flew," she said, and as she said the word 'flew' she raised her arms and stepped off into thin air. Half a second later they heard a thud. That was Pippi hitting the ground.

Tommy and Annika lay down on their stomachs and peered down at her in terror.

"I forgot to flap my arms," she said cheerfully. "Plus I probably have too many pancakes in my stomach."

At that moment the children realized that Mr. Nilsson had disappeared. He had apparently set off on a little expedition of his own. They remembered having seen him contentedly gnawing the lunch basket to shreds, but during Pippi's flying exercise they had forgotten all about him. And now he was gone.

Pippi got so angry that she threw one of her shoes into a big, deep pool of water.

"You should never take a monkey with you when you go anywhere," she said. "He really should have stayed at home and picked fleas off the horse. That would have served him right," she went on as she stepped into the pool to retrieve her shoe. The water came up to her waist.

"Actually, I might as well wash my hair while I'm here," said Pippi, ducking her head underwater for so long that bubbles started to surface.

"All right, now there's no need to go to the hairdresser this time," she continued, sounding pleased, when she finally reappeared. She climbed out of the water and put on her shoes. Then they set off to look for Mr. Nilsson.

"Hey, just listen to how it squishes when I walk!" laughed Pippi. "My clothes say 'squish, squish' and my shoes say 'slosh, slosh.' It's really funny. I think you should try it too," she said to Annika, who was walking along, looking so prim with her blonde silky hair, her pink dress, and her little white leather shoes.

"Some other time," said the sensible Annika.

They kept walking.

"It's easy to get mad at Mr. Nilsson," said Pippi. "He always does this. He once ran away from me in Surabaya and took a job as a servant with an old widow." After a pause she added, "That last part was a lie, of course."

Tommy suggested that they each go in a different direction to search. Annika was a little scared and at first didn't want to do it, but Tommy said, "You're not a coward, are you?"

That sort of scorn was too much for Annika. And. so each of the three children went off in a different direction.

Tommy took the path across the meadow. He didn't find Mr. Nilsson, but he did find something else. A bull! Or rather, the bull found Tommy, and the bull didn't care for Tommy, because that bull was an angry animal and not at all fond of children. He came rushing over with his head lowered, bellowing horribly, and Tommy gave a loud yelp of terror that could be heard through the whole woods. Pippi and Annika heard it too and came running to see why Tommy was shouting like that. By then the bull had already managed to snag Tommy with his horns and had tossed him high up in the air.

"What a foolish bull that is," said Pippi to Annika, who was crying hard. "He shouldn't be doing things like that. He's getting Tommy's white sailor suit all dirty. I'm going to have to go and talk some sense into that stupid bull."

And she did. She ran over and tugged on his tail. "Excuse me for breaking in," she said. Since she was tugging quite hard, the bull turned around and caught sight of another child that he wanted to snag with his horns. "As I said, excuse me for breaking in," Pippi repeated. "And excuse me for breaking this off," she added as she broke off one of the bull's horns. "This year it's no longer fashionable to have two horns," she said. "This year all the better bulls have only one horn. Or none at all," she said as she broke off the other horn.

Since bulls have no feeling in their horns, the bull didn't know that his horns were gone. But he started vigorously t
butting Pippi, and if she had been anyone else, the bull would have made mincemeat of her.

"Ha ha ha, stop tickling me," cried Pippi. "You have no idea how ticklish I am. Ha ha, stop, stop, I'm going to die laughing!"

But the bull didn't stop, and finally Pippi jumped up onto his back to get a moment's peace. But the peace didn't last long, of course, because the bull didn't like having Pippi on his back. He started a terrific bucking to shake her off, but she just squeezed her legs tight and held on. The bull rushed back and forth in the meadow, bellowing so hard that smoke seemed to be pouring out of his nostrils. Pippi laughed and shrieked and waved to Tommy and Annika, who stood some distance away, shaking like aspen leaves. The bull spun around and around, trying to throw Pippi off.


"Here I am dancing with my little friend," hummed Pippi, not budging from where she sat. Finally the bull was so tired that he lay down on the ground, wishing that there were no children in the whole wide world. For that matter, he never had thought that children were especially necessary.

"Are you planning to take an afternoon nap now?" Pippi asked the bull politely. "In that case, I won't disturb you."

She climbed down from his back and went over to Tommy and Annika. Tommy had been crying a little. He had a cut on one arm, but Annika had wrapped her handkerchief around it, and it didn't hurt anymore.

"Oh, Pippi," shouted Annika, bubbling with excitement, when Pippi came over to them.

"Shh," whispered Pippi. "Don't wake the bull! He's sleeping, and if we wake him up he'll just get cranky."

But the next second she shouted in a loud voice, "Mr. Nilsson, Mr. Nilsson, where are you?" She wasn't paying any attention to the bull's afternoon nap. "We have to go home now."

And believe it or not, there sat Mr. Nilsson, huddled up in a pine tree. He was sucking on his tail and looked quite miserable. It was no fun for such a little monkey to be left all alone in the woods. Now he scampered down from the pine tree and leaped onto Pippi's shoulder. He began waving his straw hat the way he always did whenever he was really happy.

"So, you didn't become a servant this time, did you?" said Pippi, stroking his back. "No wait, that's true, it was a lie," she added. "But if it was true, it couldn't be a lie, could it?" she pondered. "When all is said and done, he might actually have been a servant in Surabaya, after all! If so, I know who's going to make the
meatballs from now on."

And then they headed home. Pippi's dress was still' squishing, and her shoes were sloshing. Tommy and Annika thought they'd had a wonderful day in spite of the bull, and they sang a song that they'd learned in school. It was actually a summer song, but even though it would soon be autumn, they thought that it was the right song to be singing:

On a summery and sunny day
we walk through green woods on the way,
not a word of complaint, come what may.
we sing as we go. Sing high, sing low!
The young among you
come and sing too.
Don't sit home with nothing to do.
Our singing group
climbs as one troop,
reaching the top in one fell swoop.
On a summery and sunny day
we sing as we go. Sing high, sing low!

Pippi sang along too, but she wasn't really singing* the same words. This is what she sang:

On a summery and sunny day
I walk through green woods on the way,
saying whatever I want to say.
And it sloshes as I go.
Slosh slow, slosh slow!
And in my shoe it squishes too.
It says first ahem and then ah-choo.
My shoe is wet.
A bull we met.
Rice pudding is the best thing yet.
On a summery and sunny day it sloshes as I go.
Slosh slow, slosh Slow!
