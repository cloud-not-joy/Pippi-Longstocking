One Day Tommy and Annika found a note in their mailbox.

To TMMY AN ANIKA

is said on the envelope. And when they opened it they found a card that said:

TMMY AN ANIKA SHUD COME TO PIPPIS HOUSE FOR A BURTHDAY PARTEE TOMORO AFTERNOON.
U CAN WARE WATEVER U LIKE.

That made Tommy and Annika so happy that they started jumping around and dancing. They had no problem understanding what the card said, even though the spelling was a little odd. Pippi had gone to a great deal of trouble to write it. Now it's true that she had said she didn't recognize the letter "i" that day when she went to school, but the fact was that she actually did know how to writeâ€”at least a little. When she was sailing the seven seas, one of the sailors on her father's ship would sometimes sit with her on the quarterdeck in the evening and try to teach her to write. Unfortunately, Pippi was not a very patient student.

In the middle of everything she might say, "No, Fridolf" (the sailor's name was Fridolf), "no, Fridolf, I just don't care about all this. I'm going to climb up to the crow's nest and see what the weather will be like tomorrow."

That's why it wasn't so strange that she had trouble writing. She spent a whole night working on that invitation. Then early in the morning, just as the stars were beginning to fade over the roof of Villa Villekulla, she slipped over to Tommy and Annika's house to put the note in their mailbox.
