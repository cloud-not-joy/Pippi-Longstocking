# Chapter Nine Pippi Has Coffee with the Ladies

Tommy and Annika's mother had invited several ladies over for coffee, and since she had done so much baking, she said that Tommy and Annika could invite Pippi at the same time. That way her own children would be much less trouble, or so she believed.

Tommy and Annika were thrilled when they heard this, and they immediately ran over to Pippi's house to invite her. Pippi was in her garden using an old rusty watering can to water whatever poor flowers were still left. Since rain was pouring down from the sky that day, Tommy told Pippi that it didn't really seem necessary.

"Well, that's easy for you to say," said Pippi sternly. "But I lay awake all night, looking forward to getting up and watering my flowers, so I'm not going to let a little rain stop me, let me tell you!"

 Then Annika told her the wonderful news.

 "Coffee with the ladies . . . me?" cried Pippi. And she got so nervous that she started to water Tommy instead of the rosebush as she had intended. "Oh, I don't know! It makes me nervous. What if I can't behave properly?"

 "I'm sure you can," said Annika.

"Don't be so sure about that," said Pippi. "I'll do my best, believe me. But I've noticed many times that people don't think I can behave properly, even though I try my very best. Out at sea we were never so fussy about such things. But I promise to try really hard today so that you won't have to be ashamed of me."
