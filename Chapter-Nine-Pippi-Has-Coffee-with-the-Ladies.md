# Chapter Nine Pippi Has Coffee with the Ladies

Tommy and Annika's mother had invited several ladies over for coffee, and since she had done so much baking, she said that Tommy and Annika could invite Pippi at the same time. That way her own children would be much less trouble, or so she believed.

Tommy and Annika were thrilled when they heard this, and they immediately ran over to Pippi's house to invite her. Pippi was in her garden using an old rusty watering can to water whatever poor flowers were still left. Since rain was pouring down from the sky that day, Tommy told Pippi that it didn't really seem necessary.

"Well, that's easy for you to say," said Pippi sternly. "But I lay awake all night, looking forward to getting up and watering my flowers, so I'm not going to let a little rain stop me, let me tell you!"

 Then Annika told her the wonderful news.

 "Coffee with the ladies . . . me?" cried Pippi. And she got so nervous that she started to water Tommy instead of the rosebush as she had intended. "Oh, I don't know! It makes me nervous. What if I can't behave properly?"

 "I'm sure you can," said Annika.

"Don't be so sure about that," said Pippi. "I'll do my best, believe me. But I've noticed many times that people don't think I can behave properly, even though I try my very best. Out at sea we were never so fussy about such things. But I promise to try really hard today so that you won't have to be ashamed of me."

"Good," said Tommy, and then he and Annika raced back home through the rain.

"This afternoon at three o'clock. Don't forget," called Annika, peeking out from under her umbrella.

That afternoon at three o'clock a very elegant young lady went up the stairs to the Settergren Home.

It was Pippi Longstocking. For a change she was not wearing her red hair in braids. It hung down to her shoulders like a lion's mane. She had used a red crayon to color her lips bright red, and she had made her eyebrows so dark that she looked slightly sinister. She had also used the red crayon to color her fingernails, and on her shoes she wore big green bows.

"I know I'm going to be the most elegant person at this party," she muttered happily to herself as she rang the doorbell.

In the Settergrens' living room sat three refined ladies, along with Tommy and Annika and their mother. A marvelous spread of food had been set on the table, and a fire was burning in the fireplace. The ladies were quietly chatting with each other as Tommy and Annika sat on the sofa and looked through a photo album. Everything was so peaceful.

But suddenly the peace was shattered.

"Company—ATTEN-SHUN!"

A piercing shout came from the hall, and the next second Pippi Longstocking was standing in the doorway. She had shouted so loudly and so unexpectedly that the ladies had actually jumped.

"Company—forward, MARCH!" Pippi shouted next, and then she marched briskly over to Mrs. Settergren.

"Company—HALT!" She stopped.

"Present arms, one, TWO!" she yelled, and she used both hands to grab one of Mrs. Settergren's, which she shook quite heartily.

"Knees, BEND!" she shouted, and she curtsied beautifully.

Then she smiled at Mrs. Settergren and said in her usual voice, "I'm actually quite shy, so if I didn't issue commands to myself I'd just stand in the hall, quite stubborn, and not dare to come in."

After that she rushed over to the other ladies and kissed each of them on the cheek.

"Charmed, charmed, I'm sure," she said because she had once heard a distinguished gentleman say this to a lady. And then she sat down on the best chair in the room. Mrs. Settergren had planned for the children to stay upstairs in Tommy and Annika's room, but Pippi calmly sat where she was, slapping her knees and casting glances at the food on the table.

"That looks delicious. When do we start?"

At that instant, Ella, the family's maid, came in with the coffeepot. Mrs. Settergren said, "Coffee is served!"

"Me first," shouted Pippi, and with two bounds she was over at the table. She piled onto a plate as many little cakes as it would hold, tossed five lumps of sugar into a coffee cup, emptied half the cream jug into her cup, and then went back to her chair with her plunder before the ladies had even reached the table.

Pippi stretched out her legs and balanced the plate of cakes between the tips of her toes. Then she swiftly started dipping cakes in her coffee. She stuffed so many of them in her mouth at once that she couldn't have uttered a word, no matter how hard she tried.

In the blink of an eye she finished off all the cakes on her plate. She got up, slapped the plate like a tambourine, and went back to the table to see if there were any more cakes left. The ladies gave her a disapproving look, but she didn't take any notice. Cheerfully chattering, she walked around the table, snatching a cake here and a cake there.

"It was awfully nice of you to invite me," she said. "I've never been invited to coffee before."

There was a big cream cake on the table. In the middle of it was a piece of red candy as a decoration. Pippi stood with her hands behind her back and looked at it. All of a sudden she leaned forward and snatched up the candy in her teeth. But she had bent down a little too quickly, and when she straightened up, her whole face was covered with cream.

"Ha ha ha," laughed Pippi. "Now we can play blindman's-buff, because we already have a blindfold, and it's absolutely free. I can't see a thing."

Then she stuck out her tongue and licked off all the cream.

"Well, that was really quite an accident," she said. "But now the cake is just going to go to waste, so I might as well eat the whole thing."

And she did. She launched into it with a cake server, and in a matter of minutes the whole cake was gone. Pippi patted her stomach contentedly. Mrs. Settergren had gone out to the kitchen for a moment so she knew nothing about the accident with the cake. But the other ladies were giving Pippi very stern looks. They probably would have liked some of that cake themselves. Pippi noticed that they didn't look pleased, and she decided to cheer them up.

"Let's not be sad about such a small and unfortunate incident," she consoled them. "The main thing is that we have our health. And besides, you're supposed to have fun when you're invited for coffee."

She picked up the sugar bowl and scattered the lumps of sugar all over the floor.

"Oh, what's this?" she cried in a shrill voice. "How1 could I ever make such a mistakel I thought it was granulated sugar, the kind that you're supposed to sprinkle. But now the damage is done. Luckily there's only one thing to do if you happen to sprinkle lumps of sugar by mistake—you have to do the opposite and try to make the granulated sugar into lumps."

With these words she picked up a container of granulated sugar from the table and sprinkled sugar on her tongue, trying hard to shape it into lumps.

"Well, there you see," she said. "If it doesn't work, nothing will."
