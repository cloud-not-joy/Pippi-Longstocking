# Pippi Dances with Burglars

After Pippi's performance at the circus, there wasn't a single person in the whole little town who didn't know how incredibly strong she was. There was even something about her in the newspaper. But people who lived elsewhere, of course, didn't know who Pippi was.

One dark autumn night two tramps came trudging along the road past Villa Villekulla. The tramps were two shabby burglars who had set off to roam through the country, looking for things to steal. They saw lights on in the windows of Villa Villekulla, and they decided to go inside and ask for a sandwich.

That night Pippi had poured all her gold coins out on the kitchen floor, and she was sitting there counting them. She wasn't actually very good at counting, but occasionally she did it all the same. Just to keep things in order.

"...seventy-five, seventy-six, seventy-seven, seventy-eight, seventy-nine, seventy-ten, seventy- eleven, seventy-twelve, seventy-thirteen, seventy- seventeen ... I seem to be stuck on seventy! Good gracious, surely there must be some other numbers in the number nebula. Oh, that's right, I remember now: one hundred and four, one thousand. That's certainly a lot of money," said Pippi.

At that moment someone pounded on the door.

"Come in or stay outside, whatever you like," yelled Pippi. "I'm not forcing anybody!"

The door opened and the two tramps came in. Just imagine how big their eyes got when they saw a little red-headed girl sitting on the floor all alone,
counting money!

"Are you home by yourself?" they asked slyly.

"Not at all," said Pippi. "Mr. Nilsson is home too."

The burglars couldn't know, of course, that Mr. - Nilsson was a little monkey who was asleep in his green-painted bed with a doll's blanket pulled over him. They thought that the master of the house was named Nilsson, and they gave each other a meaningful wink.

"Let's come back a little later," was what they meant by that wink. But to Pippi they said, "Well, we just came in to see what your clock says."

They were so excited that they forgot all about the sandwiches.

"Big, strong fellows like you, and you don't even know what a clock says?" said Pippi. "Who brought you up, anyway? Haven't you ever heard a clock before? A clock is a little round thingamajig that says 'tick tock' and keeps going and going but never gets to the door. If you know any other riddles, let's hear them," said Pippi to encourage them.

The tramps thought that Pippi was too young to know about clocks, so without another word they turned on their heels and left.

"I'm not asking you to play tic-tac-toe!" Pippi yelled after them. "But you could at least play along with my tick-tock riddle. I don't know what makes you tick! But never mind, go in peace," said Pippi, and she went back to counting her money.

Safely outside, the tramps rubbed their hands with glee.

"Did you see all that money? Good heavens!" said one of them.

"Yeah, we're really in luck," said the other. "All we have to do is wait until the girl and that Nilsson go to sleep. Then we'll sneak inside and get our mitts on all that money."

They sat down under an oak tree in the garden to wait. It was drizzling, and they were very hungry, so it wasn't especially pleasant, but the thought of all that money kept their spirits high.

The lights went out in the other houses, one by one, but in Villa Villekulla the lights stayed on. This was because Pippi was learning to dance a polka, and she didn't want to go to bed until she was positive that she could do it right. But finally the windows in Villa Villekulla also went dark.

The tramps waited quite a while to make sure that » Mr. Nilsson would be asleep. Finally they sneaked over to the kitchen door and got ready to pry it open with their burglary tools. Then one of them—whose name was Blom, by the way—happened by chance to try the door. It wasn't locked.

"How stupid can people be?" he whispered to his partner. "Look at this—the door is open!"

"All the better for us," replied his partner, a black- haired man called Thunder-Karlsson by those who knew him.

Thunder-Karlsson switched on his flashlight, and then they sneaked into the kitchen. No one was there. The room next to it was Pippi's bedroom, which was also where Mr. Nilsson's little doll's bed stood.

Thunder-Karlsson opened the door and cautiously peeked inside. It was nice and quiet, and he let the beam of his flashlight play over the room.

When the beam came to Pippi's bed, both tramps saw to their surprise that there was nothing but a pair of feet resting on the pillow. As usual, Pippi had her head under the covers at the foot of the bed.

"That must be the girl," whispered Thunder- Karlsson to Blom. "And she seems to be sound asleep. But where on earth do you think Nilsson is?"

"Mister Nilsson; if you don't mind," said Pippi's calm voice from under the covers. "Mister Nilsson is sleeping in the little green doll's bed."

The tramps were so startled that they were just about to rush out. But then they happened to think about what Pippi had said. Mr. Nilsson was sleeping in the doll's bed. And in the beam of the flashlight they caught sight of the doll's bed and the little monkey who was lying in it. Thunder-Karlsson couldn't help laughing.

"Blom," he said. "Mr. Nilsson is a monkey, ha ha ha!"

"Well, what did you think he was?" said Pippi's calm voice from under the covers. "A lawnmower?"

"Aren't your mamma and pappa home?" asked Blom.

"Nope," said Pippi. "They're gone! Gone far away!'"

Thunder-Karlsson and Blom were so delighted that they started chuckling.

"Now listen here, little girl," said Thunder- Karlsson, "come out of there so we can talk to you!"

"Nope," said Pippi. "I'm sleeping. Does this have to do with more riddles? If that's the case, you'll have to answer this one first: What kind of clock goes and goes but never gets to the door?"

Then Blom took a firm grip on the covers and lifted them off.

"Can you dance a polka?" asked Pippi, giving him a serious look. "I can!"

"You ask too many questions," said Thunder- Karlsson. "Why don't you let us ask a few questions now? For instance, where did you put the money that you had out on the floor a while ago?"

"In the suitcase in the cabinet," replied Pippi truthfully.

Thunder-Karlsson and Blom grinned.

"I hope you won't mind, my dear, if we take it," said Thunder-Karlsson.

"Oh, not at all," said Pippi. "Of course not."

And with that, Blom went over and took out the suitcase.

"I hope you won't mind, my dear, if I take it back," said Pippi, as she climbed out of bed and went over to Blom.

Blom didn't really know what happened, but somehow the suitcase suddenly ended up in Pippi's hand.

"Quit joking around," said Thunder-Karlsson angrily. "Give me that suitcase!"

He grabbed Pippi hard by the arm and tried to yank the plunder away from her.

"Who says I was joking?" said Pippi as she lifted Thunder-Karlsson on top of the cabinet. The next instant Blom was sitting there too. Then both of the tramps were scared. They began to realize that Pippi was not exactly an ordinary girl. But the suitcase was still tempting them, so they pushed aside their fear.

"All together now, Blom," shouted Thunder-Karlsson, and then they jumped down from the cabinet and rushed at Pippi, who was holding the suitcase in her hand. But Pippi jabbed them with her finger and they each landed in opposite corners of the room.

Before they could get to their feet, Pippi got out a rope, and quick as a wink she tied up the arms and legs of both burglars. Now they started singing a different tune.

"My dear, sweet little girl," pleaded Thunder- Karlsson. "Please forgive us. We were only joking! Don't hurt us. We're just a couple of poor tramps who came in to ask for a little food."

Blom even managed to shed a few tears.

Pippi put the suitcase back in its place in the cabinet. Then she turned to face her prisoners.

"Can either of you dance a polka?"

"Hmm ... well ..." said Thunder-Karlsson. "I suppose we both can."

"Oh, what fun!" said Pippi, clapping her hands. "Couldn't we dance for a bit? I've just learned how, you see."

"Er ... of course," said Thunder-Karlsson, rather surprised.

Then Pippi got out a big pair of scissors and cut off the ropes that were holding her visitors.

"But we don't have any music," said Pippi anxiously. Then she had an idea.

"Could you blow on a comb?" she said to Blom. "Then I'll dance with him." And she pointed to Thunder-Karlsson.

Yes, of course, Blom could blow on a comb. And that's what he did, so loudly that it could be heard through the whole house. Mr. Nilsson was startled awake, and he sat up in bed just in time to see Pippi whirling around with Thunder-Karlsson. Her expression was dead serious, and she was dancing with such energy, as if her life depended on it.

Finally Blom refused to blow on the comb any more because he claimed that it was tickling his lips so terribly. And Thunder-Karlsson's legs were starting to get tired, since he'd been trudging along the road all day long.

"Oh please, just a little bit more," begged Pippi as she kept on dancing. And there was nothing for Blom and Thunder-Karlsson to do but keep going.

When it was three in the morning, Pippi said, "Oh, I could keep on like this until Thursday! But maybe you're tired or hungry?"

That was exactly what they were, although they hardly dared say so. From the pantry Pippi brought out bread and cheese and butter and ham and a cold roast and milk, and then they all sat down at the table—Blom and Thunder-Karlsson and Pippi—and* they ate until they were stuffed to the gills.

Pippi poured a little milk in one ear. "It's good for an earache," she said.

"You poor thing. Do you have an earache?" asked Blom.

"Nope," said Pippi. "But I might get one."

Finally both tramps stood up, thanked Pippi for the food, and said that they would have to be going.

"I'm so glad you came! Do you really have to leave so soon?" said Pippi sadly. "I've never seen anyone who can dance a polka like you can, my sweet little sugar pig," she said to Thunder-Karlsson. "And be sure to keep practicing at playing the comb," she told Blom. "Then you won't notice that it tickles."

As they headed out of the door Pippi came running to give each of them a gold coin.

"You've certainly earned it," she said.
