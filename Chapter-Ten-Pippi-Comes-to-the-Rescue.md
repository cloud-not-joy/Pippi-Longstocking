# Pippi Comes to the Rescue

One Sunday afternoon Pippi was wondering what to do. Tommy and Annika had been invited out to tea with their mother and father, so she couldn't expect a visit from them.

The day had been filled with pleasant activities. She woke up early and served Mr. Nilsson juice and rolls in bed. He looked so sweet as he sat there in his light blue nightshirt, holding the glass with both hands. Then she fed and groomed the horse, telling him a long story about her travels at sea. After that she went into the living room and painted a big picture on the wallpaper. The painting showed a fat woman in a red dress and black hat. In one hand she was holding a yellow flower and in the other a dead mouse. Pippi thought it was a very beautiful painting. It spruced up the whole room.

Then she sat down in front of the cabinet and looked at all her birds' eggs and seashells. They reminded her of all the wonderful places where she and her pappa had collected them . . . and the nice little shops around the world where they had bought all the fine things . .that were now in the drawers of her cabinet.

After that she tried to teach Mr. Nilsson to dance the polka, but he didn't want to learn. For a moment she considered trying to teach the horse, but instead she crawled inside the firewood box and closed the lid. She pretended that she was a sardine in a sardine can, and it was so annoying that Tommy and Annika weren't there so that they could be sardines too.

But now it was starting to get dark. She pressed her little potato nose against the windowpane and looked out at the autumn twilight. Then she happened to think about the fact that she hadn't been out for a ride on her horse for a couple of days, and so that's what she decided to do. It would be a pleasant way to end a most agreeable Sunday.
