# Pippi Goes To The Circus

A circus had come to the little town, and all the children ran to their mothers and fathers to ask permission to go. Tommy and Annika did too, and their nice pappa promptly gave them several lovely silver kronor. With the coins held tightly in their hands, they rushed off to find Pippi. She was on the porch with her horse, busy twisting his tail into tiny braids, which she tied with red bows.

"It's his birthday today. At least I think it is," she said. "And that's why he has to look nice."

"Pippi," said Tommy, huffing and puffing because they had run so fast, "Pippi, do you want to go to the circus?"

"I can go to almost anything," said Pippi, "but I'm not sure whether I can go to a surkus because I don't know what a surkus is. Does it hurt?"
